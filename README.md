Prerequisites
To run our app it is necessary to use a Web server. Our suggestions are :
•	For Windows : WampServer - http://www.wampserver.com/
•	For MAC OS : MANP - https://www.mamp.info/en/
•	Or Xampp - https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html 
Once installed you will need to create user and a password to access all of your databases. Keep them in mind we will need them in the future.
To run the app we chose to use Intellij (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ if you wish to download it).

Installing
Now you have our code in front of you ! In order to run the app correctly here are a few steps to follow :

•	Go to ressources>application.properties

You will have to change what is highlighted with your username and password for your webserver that we told you to remember before.

•	Go to java>com.example.cookie>CookieApplication and run the project !
Nearly done there, one last step !

•	In order to keep you users and not erase your database everytime you run the app, go to ressources>application.properties

And change what is highlighted, “create” to “update”.

You’re all set ! Hope you will enjoy using the cookie website ! If you have any suggestion or contribution please contact us :
